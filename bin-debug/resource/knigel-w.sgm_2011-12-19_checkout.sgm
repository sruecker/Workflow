Rasselas returns to the capital and puts down the rebellion, but further political intrigues ensue which result in his imprisonment in the Happy Valley. The arrival of Dinarbas (now, after various adventures, the emissary of the Sultan of Constantinople) and the subsequent arrival of the Turkish army serves as a turning point and eventually order is restored: Rasselas is proclaimed emperor and the novel <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="marriage ending">ends with the marriages</TMOTIF> of Dinarbas and Nekayah, and Rasselas and Zilia.</P><P>Both <TITLE TITLETYPE="MONOGRAPHIC">Rasselas</TITLE> and <TITLE TITLETYPE="MONOGRAPHIC">Dinarbas</TITLE> are concerned with the <TTHEMETOPIC>issue of happiness</TTHEMETOPIC>: the questions whether happiness is possible and how it is to be achieved.

ECK became a classical scholar; after her father&apos;s death in 1775 she went abroad with her mother for economy. After seeing Paris, Toulouse, Rome, and Naples (meeting Hester PIOZZI), she pub. at Genoa her highly popular {FCabbrevTitle}Dinarbas{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1790, romantic sequel and riposte to Johnson&apos;s {FCabbrevTitle}Rasselas{/FCabbrevTitle}: prince and princess marry a sister and brother and attain happiness (see Ann Messenger in essays, 1986). In Rome again, ECK completed {FCabbrevTitle}Marcus Flaminius{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1791, an epistolary novel about frontier and metropolitan life under the Roman empire, well researched and widely admired but financially disappointing. In Naples again, she wrote poems about love, patriotism, and Nelson (being linked with his notorious love-affair later embarrassed her). Returning as a refugee to England, she published {FCabbrevTitle}Latium{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1805, a cultivated tourist&apos;s guide to Rome and its environs, with her own fine etchings. She held court posts with the Queen (publishing, 1809-12, brief histories of Spain and France, poems and translations) and Princess Charlotte; loyalty to the latter through all emotional vagaries brought dismissal.
